    "# Deliverable Instructions - Repository Management\n",
    "\n",
    "All Python templates for this project are available on the [Bitbucket website](https://bitbucket.org/mkempenaar/diagnosticgenomeanalysis/raw/master/templates/). Instead of **downloading** these files directly and editing those, you will create your own version (copy) of the online repository (a so called *fork*), clone this repository to disk, edit the files and update your repository. The goal of this procedure is to get familiar with managing a repository, something that will be repeated often during your study.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/fork.png\" style=\"float: right;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, you are required to create a Bitbucket account that will hold the external repository. You can use your student email (`...@st.hanze.nl`) or your bioinf-email (`...@bioinf.nl`, see the note below). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: you are required to verify your email which is slightly annoying when using your `username@bioinf.nl` address;\n",
    "* Open a Terminal and enter the `mutt` command (a commandline email-client),\n",
    "* Select the *Please verify your email address* mail from Atlassian using the arrow keys,\n",
    "* Open the email using the Enter key,\n",
    "* Type `v` to view the HTML attachment(s),\n",
    "* Press Enter to open the HTML attachment in your browser,\n",
    "* Click the *verify your email* button,\n",
    "* Quit Mutt by pressing the `q`-key until you're back in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, login to Bitbucket and go to the repository [Bitbucket website](https://bitbucket.org/mkempenaar/diagnosticgenomeanalysis). On the left-hand menu there is a `+`-sign (see example on the right) which shows the *Fork this repository* link when clicked. Use this link to create your own fork of the repository. Make sure that the *make private* is selected which prevents others from viewing your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/private_fork.png\" width=\"450\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have created a fork of the repository, you can download the files by *cloning* the repository on disk. Once you are on your project website you'll see a link that can be used to clone the repository. Open a terminal and go to a folder where the project can be downloaded and paste the `git clone ...` link. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will download everything (including the Jupyter Notebook files that you are reading now) into the `diagnosticgenomeanalysis` folder. In here, there is a folder `templates` containing the Python template files. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these templates can be executed without adding any code but it might (depending on the deliverable) show a message that the output is incorrect (try it!).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Updating the Fork\n",
    "\n",
    "Handing in the solutions to the assignments is done through updating your fork with the solutions. There are two steps to be taken to do this:\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/bitbucket_invite.png\" style=\"float: right;\" />\n",
    "* Invite the teacher to get *read* access to your repository:\n",
    "    * Click the *Send Invitation* button to open the *Share* window and add the user `m.kempenaar@pl.hanze.nl` or `r.wedema@pl.hanze.nl` depending on who you have as teacher\n",
    "    * Make sure the rights are set to *READ* and click the *Share* button\n",
    "* *Push* changes to the templates to your repository:\n",
    "    * Once you've made changes to the templates or added other files, you can add them to your repository:\n",
    "        * Open a terminal and go to the folder containing the `templates/` folder\n",
    "        * Assess the differences using the `git status` command\n",
    "        * Add the changes so git knows what to update using `git add`\n",
    "        * Commit the changes to the repository with `git commit -m \"A complete commit message\"`\n",
    "        * Push the updates to Bitbucket with `git push -u origin master`\n",
    "\n",
    "It adviced to commit & push the changes once a deliverable is finished instead of a single commit containing all the work. This can also be used to keep the code synchronized between multiple computers. When working on a different computer once again clone your fork using the `git clone ...` command. To keep any of the clones up-to-date, execute the `git pull` command which will try to synchronize the files on disk with those in the online repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to execute this command *before* changing any files to prevent so called *conflicts*.
